# React Portfolio Website - Farzad Sanjarani

## Introductions

Welcome to my personal portfolio website built with ReactJS. This project showcases my skills, projects, and professional experiences. The website is designed to be a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly platform for potential employers, collaborators, and clients to explore my work.

## Features
Responsive Design: Ensures that the website is accessible on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
Dynamic Content: Integrates with GitHub API to showcase repositories and other dynamic content such as blogs or designs.
Contact Form: Allows visitors to reach out directly through the website.
Navigation: Smooth scrolling and reactive navigation bar for easy browsing.

## Technologies Used
ReactJS: For building the user interface with component-based architecture.
React Router: For enabling navigation between different sections of the website without refreshing the page.
Tailwind CSS Modules: For styling components individually to avoid style leakage.
Vercel: For hosting the website with automatic deployment from the GitHub repository.
